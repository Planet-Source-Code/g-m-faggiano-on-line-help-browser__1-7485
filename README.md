## On\-Line Help Browser


</div>

### Description

Gives your users the look and feel of a help window. I use this method because I love Visual Basic, but with the run-time libraries required, the application download is large enough without adding help files to it. This way, I can store my help files on-line. This is also handy because I can update the help documentation without the user having to download any updates or patches!
 
### More Info
 
All explanations are included in the project files. Comes with a demo exe.
